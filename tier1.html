        <h2>What’s Included</h2>
        <p>
          Tier 1 gives you ready-to-use legal templates you can customize and reuse.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>NDA (Mutual)</strong> – Protects confidential information when both sides are sharing ideas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Promissory Note</strong> – Simple loan / repayment terms for lending or borrowing money.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Single-Member LLC Operating Agreement</strong> – Core document that outlines how your one-owner LLC is run.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fine-print">
          These are practical, plain-language templates designed to be reused as your business grows.
        </p>
