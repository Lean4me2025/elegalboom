        <h2 class="subheading">What Tier 2 Includes</h2>
        <p>
          Your customized Tier 2 package builds on Tier 1 and adds the legal
          structure multi-owner businesses need.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Partnership Agreement</strong> – Defines the relationship,
            responsibilities, equity split, profit-sharing, and decision-making
            between partners.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Two-Member LLC Operating Agreement</strong> – Outlines
            ownership percentages, management structure, capital contributions,
            voting rules, distributions, and exit terms for a 2-owner LLC.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>All Tier 1 documents</strong> – NDA (Mutual), Promissory
            Note, and Single-Member LLC Operating Agreement included.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fine-print">
          These documents are written in practical, plain language so you can
          actually understand and reuse them as your business grows.
        </p>

      <div class="card-box">

          <li>
            Want state-aligned legal templates tailored from a simple intake form.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complete the guided intake.</strong> Our Customer Input form

            <strong>We assemble your templates.</strong> You receive a

            Tier 1 documents customized with your details.
          </li>

          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="fine-print">
          State fees are separate: any state or agency filing fees are not
          included. We do not submit or pay filings on your behalf. Instead, we
          equip you with clean documents and plain-English guidance so you can
          file with confidence.
