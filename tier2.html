        <h2 class="card-heading">What Tier 2 Includes</h2>
        <p>
          Your customized Tier 2 package builds on Tier 1 and adds the structure
          multi-owner businesses need.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Partnership Agreement –</strong> Defines the relationship,
            responsibilities, equity split, profit-sharing, and decision-making
            between partners.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Two-Member LLC Operating Agreement –</strong> Outlines ownership
            percentages, management structure, financial contributions, voting rules,
            profit allocation, and dissolution terms for a 2-owner LLC.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>All Tier 1 documents –</strong> NDA, Promissory Note, and
            Single-Member LLC Operating Agreement are included so you have the full
            base library.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="info-card">

          <li>Ownership percentages and capital contributions.</li>
          <li>
